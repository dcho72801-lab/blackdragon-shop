# BLACKDRAGON FF - Ready-to-deploy (Vite + React)

This package is a ready-to-deploy React app (Vite). It is a shop mockup for selling Free Fire accounts with admin panel, cart, and mock checkout options.

## Quick steps to run locally
1. Install Node.js (16+) and npm.
2. In project folder:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Open `http://localhost:5173`

Admin login: user `admin`, pass `shopadmin`.

## Deploying to Vercel (recommended, minimal steps)
1. Create a GitHub repo and push this project (or upload the files to GitHub).
2. Go to https://vercel.com, sign in, click **Import Project**, choose GitHub, select repo.
3. Keep build command `npm run build` and output dir `dist`. Deploy.
Vercel will build and provide a public URL.

## If you want me to deploy for you
I cannot deploy to your account without credentials. But I can:
- Prepare this zip (this file).
- Give you exact one-click instructions to deploy.
- Or, if you give me temporary access to a GitHub repo or Vercel (invite), I can deploy it for you.
